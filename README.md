# Webhook Validation with PowerShell

## Objective

The objective of this project is to validate the functionality of a webhook by sending a sample JSON payload using PowerShell and confirming the response status.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to verify the setup and operation of a webhook by sending a mock JSON payload and checking the received response status. The provided PowerShell script simulates an interaction with a webhook endpoint, making it ideal for testing webhook configurations before actual implementation.
